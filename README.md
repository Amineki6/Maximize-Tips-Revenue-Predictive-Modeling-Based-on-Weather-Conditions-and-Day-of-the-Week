# Maximize Tips Revenue Predictive Modeling Based on Weather Conditions and Day of the Week

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the best days to work in order to maximize tip earnings. By analyzing historical data on tips, weather conditions, and order prices, the model provides actionable insights on how weather and the day of the week impact tip amounts. The goal is to enable workers to strategically choose their shifts for higher earnings.
